             <p>I have spent soo much time working on the tree house stuff that
               I get lost in reaching the next goal. At times I even think that
               I need to spend more time just trying this stuff instead of doing
               the accomplishments. It's a trap and it makes me feel small and
               not ready to hop out into the open</p>

             <p>Why wont this work. I have knowledge and have done a lot of work
               understanding things but, I feel a disconnect in what I code and
               what I am thinking. I go to bed thinking code and think code when
               I day dream. This is that and that is this. However, I go to
               implement the thoughts into reality and I get befuddled. Back to
               studying.

            <p>I have made it through all the css tutorials at this point on
            treehouse. I like them but I do think that their estimations for the
            time frame is off. Sure you could do them in the alotment that they
            say, but not really. You constantly stop write stuff down, go back over
            material, think about it, and test it. All of that adds tons of time
            to the "watching." I still feel like I'm on a sinking ship. However,
            now I have a couple of planks of wood to hold onto. Its not a life raft
            or even a jacket, but at least it something.</p>

          <li>
            <p>I had spent a lot of time working on getting things rolling with my team and felt like I had gotten pretty far. I was wrong and it made me flustered. Up until presentation I was feeling pretty good. I knew what we had made had flaws and needed work. To me it had been a learning and growing exersize which I had done quite a bit of. I was having fun and after class I was not having fun. I felt like crap.</p>
